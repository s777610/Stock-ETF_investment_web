This Web-App shows some of my investment.
First of all, it uses Yahoo finance API and datareader to extract financial data.
Next, it analyzes data by using pandas, and store data into DataFrame.
Then, it uses bokeh to plot interative chart on the web and shows some information.
It uses Flask as framework to build the web.
