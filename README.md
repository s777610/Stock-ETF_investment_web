## Link: https://weichenghung.com

This Web-App shows some of my investment.  
I used Flask as framework to build the web.  
First of all, it uses "IEX" API and datareader to extract financial data.  
Next, it analyzes data by using pandas, and store data into DataFrame.  
Then, it uses plotly to plot interative chart on the web and shows some information.  
In addition, it allow users to search the chart of any security.  
I used beautifulsoup4 to scrape the company name for the users.
