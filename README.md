This Web-App shows some of my investment.
First of all, it uses "IEX" API and datareader to extract financial data.
Next, it analyzes data by using pandas, and store data into DataFrame.
Then, it uses plotly to plot interative chart on the web and shows some information.
It uses Flask as framework to build the web.
