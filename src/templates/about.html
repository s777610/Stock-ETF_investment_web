          <p class="terminal__screen--text-context">
            Currently, I am a graduate student of IT department at California
            Lutheran University. I have experience of web development, SQL
            database, NoSQL database, data analysis, and data visualization. I
            usually spend most of my spare time for taking the online course to
            improve my coding skills. On the other hand, I am crazy about stock
            markets. Normally, I read financial books and do research on
            stock/ETF investments every single day. I have been investing in
            Taiwan stock market for a while. However, I decided to allocate my
            asset widely by investing in low-cost ETFs a few years ago.
            Therefore, I consistently invest in ETFs launched by Vanguard Group.
            Feel free to take a look at my investments.

        </h3>
        <p class="card-box__text">
          Basically, I am an index investor. Index investing is a strategy which
          is designed to match a market instead of beating it. I believe that
          after costs and taxes, index investors are able to beat average active
          investors in a market. Therefore, the majority of my investments are
          ETFs launched by Vanguard Group. I think that Vanguard Group provides
          high-quality, low-cost ETFs. Typically, I investing in ETFs is more
          interested in a diversified portfolio and want to keep my investment
          for a long period of time. However, I keep roughly 10% of my portfolio
          in the individual stock, which I am familiar with.

          &ldquo;Cost of Investment&rdquo;
        </h3>
        <p class="card-box__text">
          I think that costs can effects investment returns significantly even
          though the costs seem low. Investors cannot ignore the power of
          compounding of costs along with investment returns. In addition, no
          matter investors' assets increase or decrease, they must pay an annual
          fee. In other words, investors not only lose the annual fee they pay
          but also lose growing money might have had for years into the future.
          In short, investors should not ignore costs because the costs of
          investment are extremely harmful to investments.

        &ldquo;Asset allocation&rdquo;
      </h3>
      <p class="card-box__text">
        The purpose of the implement of asset allocation is to balance risk
        versus reward by adjusting the percentage of each asset in the
        portfolio. In my opinion, there is no "perfect" asset allocation for
        everyone. It depends on what your goal is and what kind of asset you
        familiar with. In short, you have to start with the big picture instead
        of details. For me, I am allocating my assets by continent. If your
        screen is width enough, there is an interactive-app for world GDP below,
        feel free to play around with it. We can see United States have highest
        GDP. There is why I allocate most of my asset within United States.
