      I built this online store application for my friends to sell their
      products. This is a handicraft online store. I used Flask, which is a
      framework of Python, to build the back-end for this application. The
      front-end was built by HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and Javascript . This online
      store allows users to make payments and receive the email confirmation. On
      the other hand, the seller will receive the order email as well. The order
      data are stored in SQLite locally or PostgreSQL remotely.

      This application(Loan Manager) was mainly built by React, Redux and Firebase. 
      One the back-end, it uses firebase service to create the serverless application. 
      The data is stored on firebase and the app is hosted on firebase. On the front end, 
      I use react and redux to create an interactive web page. It uses react-redux-firebase
       as the library to manipulate the state. It is very useful for me to remember who own me money..

      the front-end, it was built by React. In addition, I used Redis to cache
      the data in order to improve the performance of this app. All data is
      stored on MongoDB. All images are stored on AWS S3. For testing, I used
      jest to implement the unit test. Whenever I push code to GitHub, Travis CI
      will pull my code and build testing environment in order to run the test.

      It allows users to create wallets first. The key pair(public key and
      private key) is generated when creating the wallet. Then, users can start
      mining the new block in order to get rewards. The meaning of mining is
      doing "proof of work", which is a processing of guessing the number proof.
      The level of mining difficulty is adjustable. Users can send
      cryptocurrency to other users by assigning a public key of the recipient.
      All transactions data will be stored in open transactions temporarily.
      After mining a new block, the data of open transactions is stored in the
      new block, and open transactions will be an empty list. Majority of the
      process includes different verifications in order to make sure the system
      is secure. All node can make HTTP requests to their peer nodes in order to

      to send emails to users. The application checks the prices every 10
      minutes. All data is stored in MongoDB. All passwords of users are
      encrypted by pbkdf2. Utilizing RE to find the specific store for users.
      The price of item could be found by using beautifulsoup to parse html.
      Only admin can add the new store.
