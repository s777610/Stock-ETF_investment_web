          Currently, I am a graduate student of IT department at California Lutheran University.<br>
          I have experience of web development, SQL database, NoSQL database, data analysis, and data visualization.<br>
          I usually spend most of my spare time for taking the online course to improve my coding skills.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, I am crazy about stock markets.<br>
          Normally, I read financial books and do research on stock/ETF investments every single day.<br>
          I have been investing in Taiwan stock market for a while.<br>
          However, I decided to allocate my asset widely by investing in low-cost ETFs a few years ago.<br>
          Therefore, I consistently invest in ETFs launched by Vanguard Group.<br>
          Feel free to take a look at my investments.<br>

          Basically, I am an index investor. Index investing is a strategy which is designed to match a market instead of beating it. I believe that after costs and taxes, index investors are able to beat average active investors in a market. Therefore, the majority of my investments are ETFs launched by Vanguard Group. I think that Vanguard Group provides high-quality, low-cost ETFs. However, I keep roughly 10% of my portfolio in the individual stock, which I am familiar with.

          The purpose of the implement of asset allocation is to balance risk versus reward by adjusting the percentage of each asset in the portfolio. In my opinion, there is no "perfect" asset allocation for everyone. It depends on what your goal is and what kind of asset you familiar with. In short, you have to start with the big picture instead of details. For me, I am allocating my assets by continent.

          I think that costs can effects investment returns significantly even though the costs seem low. Investors cannot ignore the power of compounding of costs along with investment returns. In addition, no matter investors' assets increase or decrease, they must pay an annual fee. In other words, investors not only lose the annual fee they pay but also lose growing money might have had for years into the future. In short, investors should not ignore costs because the costs of investment are extremely harmful to investments.
